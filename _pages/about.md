As an incoming Ph.D. student at UMN focusing on algorithms and robotics, I aim to build computationally efficient models and algorithms to help people and robots make optimal decisions in real-time with physical interpretations, bridging the gap between pure statistical models and physics. I, therefore, endeavor to become a research scientist specializing in combining numerical algorithms and optimization.

During the 2018 summer, I finished my internship at Allen Institute for Brain Science. In the institute, I participated in multiple projects, including the development of precise single neuron and network models with genetic optimization algorithms. I also analyzed the neural data with various machine learning and statistical techniques. After the internship, I joined the UW BioRobotics Lab. I am currently working on Behavior Trees embedded Graphical Models based on medical records with Dr. Blake Hannaford.
